### About What's Here

Nearly all of my work is for companies so my personal GitHub was a little sparse. To add some content and refresh my memory about the languages, I completed several JetBrains Academy tracks so I could show some examples of my code style. The repos include final solutions for these JetBrains Academy tracks: Java Core, Java Developer, Advanced Java, Python Core and Frontend Core. Each project in a track goes through several iterations, simulating what happens in the real world where requests to add features evolve a system over time.

With my last companies, I also worked with C#, Node.js and Ruby, but JetBrains Academy did not have tracks in those areas for me to show some style examples.
