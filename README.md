### About What's Here

This is my personal GitHub account.

There are open source contributions.

I completed several JetBrains Academy tracks: Java Core, Java Developer, Advanced Java, Python Core and Frontend Core. The repos include passing solutions for these tracks.

There is a quiz building system I wrote as part of an interview process. The system was done in a serverless style using AWS and uses Node.js, API Gateway, Cognito, Lambdas and DynamoDB.

I sometimes work on LeetCode and Codility problems. Solutions that score 100% can be found [here](https://github.com/kimnetics/LeetCode) and [here](https://github.com/kimnetics/Codility).
